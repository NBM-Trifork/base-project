import { Story, Source } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has three possible states.

- [Primary](#primary)
- [Secondary](#secondary)
- [Small](#small)

## With the story title defined

If you included the title in the story's default export, use this approach.

### Primary

<Story id="components-button--primary" />

### Secondary

<Story id="components-button--secondary" />

### Small

<Story id="components-button--small" />
